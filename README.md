### Hi, I am Aroosa ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Engineer/Analyst with a background in Information Technology. I have recently completed Data analytics boot camp from UWA. The course included SQL, python, HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Tableau and a variety of other tools to handle structure and unstructured databases. I would like to bring these technological abilities to diverse industry sectors such as Energy & Resources, Healthcare, and Finance. I would also like to learn other new technologies such as AWS and Azure to increase the services I can offer to the clients. I constantly review and develop my personal and professional self. I bring a fun, energetic and focused attitude to my team, projects and workplace.
